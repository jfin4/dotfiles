I went with bong in tow. After a hurried walk I found Hoyt's nearly deserted, a surprise given how many people I noticed along the way, and how hot it was, and how early (at least an hour before the sun tucked behind the ridge). I disrobed, splashed, smoked, swam, plunged down the waterfall at the end of the canyon, and sat perched in the sun until its direct rays were no more. I then scrambled over river rock back toward the car, inventing a new sport: river parkour. It probably is already a thing. \n/home/jfin/notes/15-223-1.txt:The progression of my thoughts during this adventure: I first realized that grunginess/crustiness is actually an overcompensation for vanity, and then that vanity conversely is a compensation for worthlessness, and then therefore that the compensation model of psychology is not fundamentally correct- that people do not compensate for intrinsic characteristics with opposing superficial characteristics but rather are comprised by a multitude of dualities and are defined by which of these are "aggravated", i.e. not in a monophasic, centered state but rather in an enduring biphasic modality, somewhat like electrons that are never in any given place at any given time but somehow distributed in a "cloud" instead. \n/home/jfin/notes/15-223-1.txt:These thoughts led to the awareness that I was contributing privately to the field of psychology, and that psychology, far from being fru-fru, was actually a very exciting and ideally rigorous discipline and that the discipline of science would be immeasurably enriched through application to the psychological realm. I thought of Karen, and her past interest in formally pursuing a carreer rooted in psychology. \n/home/jfin/notes/15-223-1.txt:Upon reflecting on the importance of empirical support for psychological claims and theories, I discovered to my euphoric delight that Science systematically denies an important class of evidence: the subjective experience. In fact, the ontological basis of science seems at times to be the denial of the validity of the subjective. Pursuing this train of thought brought me a different field- that of spiritual directorship, ministry. This stimulated the awareness that the world is in fact ripe for the fruit  of a unioun between these superficially opposed fields. \n/home/jfin/notes/15-223-1.txt:The terminus of these thoughts was a bowling metaphor: our subjectivity was one of ten pins. Not the ultimate authority, and not a deniable artifact. \n/home/jfin/notes/15-223-1.txt:I then set upon inventing river parkour. \n/home/jfin/notes/16-337-1.txt:its not just about an eye for an eye. \n/home/jfin/notes/16-337-1.txt:it's not just about believing in that law or following that law. \n/home/jfin/notes/16-337-1.txt:It's about acheiving the power to live by that law, because that is a very expensive law. \n/home/jfin/notes/16-337-1.txt:Disciple ship to that law is exacting, and requires what makes you human - your soul. \n/home/jfin/notes/16-337-1.txt:religious thought is full of reverse definitions. \n/home/jfin/notes/16-337-1.txt:words are defined negatively. \n/home/jfin/notes/16-337-1.txt:concepts are define by the spaces created by a question. \n/home/jfin/notes/16-337-1.txt:we forget the opposite of a statement- the question.  \n/home/jfin/notes/16-337-1.txt:questions create space. \n/home/jfin/notes/16-337-1.txt:god is that which is and always will be beyond our understanding. \n/home/jfin/notes/16-337-1.txt:the soul is that which makes us human. \n/home/jfin/notes/16-337-1.txt:I do not know how to describe, define, or measure what it is that makes us distinct from animals.\n/home/jfin/notes/16-337-1.txt:but i believe we are different, as a bear is different from a dog.\n/home/jfin/notes/16-337-1.txt:our soul makes us different.\n/home/jfin/notes/16-337-1.txt:it is our essence. \n/home/jfin/notes/16-337-1.txt:and that is the price of power.\n/home/jfin/notes/16-337-1.txt:power takes team
